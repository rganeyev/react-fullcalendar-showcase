# Fullcalendar: react + sass = ðŸ˜¥

I removed everything, but included index.scss to the build with the following:

```
@import '@fullcalendar/common/main.css';
```

React starts well in development:

```
yarn start
```

But fails on build:
```
yarn build
yarn run v1.22.5
$ react-scripts build
Creating an optimized production build...
Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run:
npx browserslist@latest --update-db

Why you should do it regularly:
